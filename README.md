# Face Recognition Application (Similarity)
## Objective
Our objective is to create an application that captures an image of a person and compares their face with those already present in our dataset, in order to display *the 5 most similar* individuals to them.

## Dataset
The dataset we used contains images of 28 individuals, including actors such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as well as athletes like Messi, Ronaldo, and Mohamed Ali. The dataset is structured in a folder called 'Dataset', with a separate folder for each person containing their respective images.
